  Hey, I’m Ksenia! I’m into data – figuring out how things work behind the scenes and finding ways to make them better. I enjoy working with data to solve real-world problems 💡 and constantly challenge myself to try new tools and methods 🛠️. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me thinking about ways to make complicated things easier to understand 🧠 or diving deep into a new problem to crack it.
  
  I am most skilled in: <mark>Math</mark>, <mark>Time Series</mark>,<mark>Data Visualization & Reporting</mark> and <mark>Eating Sushi</mark>

  💻 What I Code With
  
  Languages & Tools
  
  🐍 Python (pandas / NumPy / scikit-learn / XGBoost / TensorFlow / Keras,  and Seaborn / Plotly / Matplotlib, and LangChain / OpenAI / Streamlit / Jupyter) — my everyday toolbox
  
  🛢️ SQL — for digging through data
  
  🔥 PySpark — when things get really big
  
  ⚙️ C++ / MATLAB — for the math-heavy stuff
  
  🗂️ Git & GitHub — because versioning saves lives

            In this role, I worked on real-world challenges—from forecasting medical equipment demand with time series models to building an internal ChatGPT-like tool for financial reporting. What truly excited me was the chance to explore massive datasets, experiment with new methods, and turn complexity into clarity—both through visualizations and by making technical ideas accessible to non-technical teams. I’ve always had a passion for math and statistics, even before they were trendy, and I love when that passion turns into practical impact.
            
            📌 Here’s an overview of my contributions:
            - Took **sparse financial data** and turned it into something meaningful by leveraging **DataBricks** and **PySpark** for powerful modeling and harmonization.
            - Developed and fine-tuned **time series forecasting models** (like **ARIMA** and **DeepAR**) to boost revenue predictions, helping the company optimize planning and decision-making.
            - Played a key role in integrating internal data sources with **GPT models**, creating smooth workflows using LangChain to supercharge internal processes.
            - Explored the potential of large language models (**LLMs**) to automate internal financial processes, significantly improving efficiency across the board.

          My time at MSUCE was where it all started - long nights with math models, unexpected breakthroughs, and the first real spark of curiosity about how data reflects the world around us. I began by analyzing economic trends in construction, and a few years later found myself diving into the strange beauty of stock market fractals. These years gave me not just two degrees, but a real passion for patterns, complexity, and making sense of the numbers behind the scenes.

          📌 Thesis topic:
          - Statistical Analysis of Stock Market Fractal Nature (M.Sc., 2021)
          - Statistical Analysis of Defined Economic Indices of Construction Industry Functioning (B.Sc., 2019)

          Key courses:
          - Mathematical Analysis and Differential Equations
          - Probability Theory, Mathematical Statistics and Theory of Random Processes
          - Numerical Methods, Mathematical Simulation and Optimization Methods 
          - Data Bases and Intelligent Systems
