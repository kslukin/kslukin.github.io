  Hey, I’m Ksenia! I’m into data 📊 – figuring out how things work behind the scenes and finding ways to make them better. I enjoy working with data to solve real-world problems 💡 and constantly challenge myself to try new tools and methods 🛠️. When I’m not coding 💻, you’ll probably find me thinking about ways to make complicated things easier to understand 🧠 or diving deep into a new problem to crack it.
  
  I am most skilled in: <mark>Math</mark>, <mark>Time Series</mark>,<mark>Data Visualization & Reporting</mark> and <mark>Eating Sushi</mark>

          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            In this role, I worked on real-world challenges—from forecasting medical equipment demand with time series models to building an internal ChatGPT-like tool for financial reporting. What truly excited me was the chance to explore massive datasets, experiment with new methods, and turn complexity into clarity—both through visualizations and by making technical ideas accessible to non-technical teams. I’ve always had a passion for math and statistics, even before they were trendy, and I love when that passion turns into practical impact.
            
            📌 Here’s an overview of my contributions:
            - Took **sparse financial data** and turned it into something meaningful by leveraging **DataBricks** and **PySpark** for powerful modeling and harmonization.
            - Developed and fine-tuned **time series forecasting models** (like **ARIMA** and **DeepAR**) to boost revenue predictions, helping the company optimize planning and decision-making.
            - Played a key role in integrating internal data sources with **GPT models**, creating smooth workflows using LangChain to supercharge internal processes.
            - Explored the potential of large language models (**LLMs**) to automate internal financial processes, significantly improving efficiency across the board.
