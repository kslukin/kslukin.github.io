  ##      I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

          In this role, I worked on real-world challenges—from forecasting medical equipment demand with time series models to building an internal ChatGPT-like tool for financial reporting. What truly excited me was the chance to explore massive datasets, experiment with new methods, and turn complexity into clarity—both through visualizations and by making technical ideas accessible to non-technical teams. I’ve always had a passion for math and statistics, even before they were trendy, and I love when that passion turns into practical impact.

      #     Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          My studies in computational and applied mathematics gave me the chance to refine my skills in data analysis, mathematical modeling, and machine learning. I focused on applying these techniques to real-world problems, with a particular emphasis on image processing and creating innovative solutions driven by data.\\
          **Thesis topics:**
          - Hypegraph *p*-Laplace Operators for Image Denoising (M.Sc., 2023) [[GitHub](https://github.com/kslukin/FAU_Master_Thesis)]

          **Key courses:**
          - Mathematical Data Science 
          - Control, machine learning and numerics
          - Modeling, simulation and optimization (Practical Course)
          - Mathematical Image Processing

          My time at MSUCE was where it all started - long nights with math models, unexpected breakthroughs, and the first real spark of curiosity about how data reflects the world around us. I began by analyzing economic trends in construction, and a few years later found myself diving into the strange beauty of stock market fractals. These years gave me not just two degrees, but a real passion for patterns, complexity, and making sense of the numbers behind the scenes.\\
          **Thesis topics:**
          - Statistical Analysis of Stock Market Fractal Nature (M.Sc., 2021)
          - Statistical Analysis of Defined Economic Indices of Construction Industry Functioning (B.Sc., 2019)
          
          **Key courses:**
          - Mathematical Analysis and Differential Equations
          - Probability Theory, Mathematical Statistics and Theory of Random Processes
          - Numerical Methods, Mathematical Simulation and Optimization Methods
          - Data Bases and Intelligent Systems
          - Programming in C++ and MATLAB
