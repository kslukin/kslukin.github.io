  Hey, I‚Äôm Ksenia! I‚Äôm into data üìä ‚Äì figuring out how things work behind the scenes and finding ways to make them better. I enjoy working with data to solve real-world problems üí° and constantly challenge myself to try new tools and methods üõ†Ô∏è. When I‚Äôm not coding üíª, you‚Äôll probably find me thinking about ways to make complicated things easier to understand üß† or diving deep into a new problem to crack it.
  
  I am most skilled in: <mark>Math</mark>, <mark>Time Series</mark>,<mark>Data Visualization & Reporting</mark> and <mark>Eating Sushi</mark>

          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            In this role, I worked on real-world challenges‚Äîfrom forecasting medical equipment demand with time series models to building an internal ChatGPT-like tool for financial reporting. What truly excited me was the chance to explore massive datasets, experiment with new methods, and turn complexity into clarity‚Äîboth through visualizations and by making technical ideas accessible to non-technical teams. I‚Äôve always had a passion for math and statistics, even before they were trendy, and I love when that passion turns into practical impact.
            
            üìå Here‚Äôs an overview of my contributions:
            - Took **sparse financial data** and turned it into something meaningful by leveraging **DataBricks** and **PySpark** for powerful modeling and harmonization.
            - Developed and fine-tuned **time series forecasting models** (like **ARIMA** and **DeepAR**) to boost revenue predictions, helping the company optimize planning and decision-making.
            - Played a key role in integrating internal data sources with **GPT models**, creating smooth workflows using LangChain to supercharge internal processes.
            - Explored the potential of large language models (**LLMs**) to automate internal financial processes, significantly improving efficiency across the board.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
