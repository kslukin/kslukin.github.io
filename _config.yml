  Hey, I’m Ksenia! I’m into data – figuring out how things work behind the scenes and finding ways to make them better. I enjoy working with data to solve real-world problems 💡 and constantly challenge myself to try new tools and methods. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me thinking about ways to make complicated things easier to understand or diving deep into a new problem to crack it.
    
  💻 What I Code With:

          After graduating, I took a break to realign my goals and invest in my personal growth. I delved into practical Data Science projects, expanded my knowledge through online platforms, and explored new tools and techniques. 
          Alongside this, I worked as a freelance maths tutor, enjoying the challenge of making complex topics accessible — and rediscovering the joy of learning through teaching. I also dedicated time to improving my German, which made me feel more at home in everyday and professional settings.

            In this role, I worked on real-world challenges - from forecasting medical equipment demand with time series models to building an internal ChatGPT-like tool for financial reporting. What truly excited me was the chance to explore massive datasets, experiment with new methods, and turn complexity into clarity - both through visualizations and by making technical ideas accessible to non-technical teams. I’ve always had a passion for math and statistics, even before they were trendy, and I love when that passion turns into practical impact.

          My time at MSUCE was where it all started - long nights with math models, unexpected breakthroughs, and the first real spark of curiosity about how data reflects the world around us. I began by analyzing economic trends in construction, and a few years later found myself diving into the strange beauty of stock market fractals. These years gave me not just two degrees, but a real passion for patterns, complexity, and making sense of the numbers behind the scenes.
