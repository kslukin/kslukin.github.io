  Hey, I’m Ksenia! I’m into data 📊 – figuring out how things work behind the scenes and finding ways to make them better. I enjoy working with data to solve real-world problems 💡 and constantly challenge myself to try new tools and methods 🛠️. 
  When I’m not coding 💻, you’ll probably find me thinking about ways to make complicated things easier to understand 🧠 or diving deep into a new problem to crack it.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Math</mark>,<mark>DS & ML🤖</mark>,  <mark>Python, SQL, PySpark</mark>,  <mark>Data Visualization & Reporting</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza 🍕</mark>

  ##      I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

       #    Solving 21st century problems by diging holes and making game changing products like the *not a flamethrower*

          In this role, I worked on real-world challenges—from forecasting medical equipment demand with time series models to building an internal ChatGPT-like tool for financial reporting. What truly excited me was the chance to explore massive datasets, experiment with new methods, and turn complexity into clarity—both through visualizations and by making technical ideas accessible to non-technical teams. I’ve always had a passion for math and statistics, even before they were trendy, and I love when that passion turns into practical impact.
          
          📌 Here’s an overview of my contributions:
          - Took **sparse financial data** and turned it into something meaningful by leveraging **DataBricks** and **PySpark** for powerful modeling and harmonization.
          - Developed and fine-tuned **time series forecasting models** (think **ARIMA** and **DeepAR**) to boost revenue predictions, helping the company optimize planning and decision-making.
          - Played a key role in integrating **internal data sources with GPT models**, creating smooth workflows using **LangChain** to supercharge internal processes.
          - Explored the potential of **large language models (LLMs)** to automate **internal financial processes**, significantly improving efficiency across the board.
 
          Technologies & Tools:  
          - **Azure DataBricks**, **PySpark**, **NumPy**, **pandas**, **NLP**, **DeepAR**, **ARIMA**, **scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, **Jupyter Notebooks**, **LangChain**, **Matplotlib**.

          
      #     Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          My time at MSUCE was where it all started - long nights with math models, unexpected breakthroughs, and the first real spark of curiosity about how data reflects the world around us. I began by analyzing economic trends in construction, and a few years later found myself diving into the strange beauty of stock market fractals. These years gave me not just two degrees, but a real passion for patterns, complexity, and making sense of the numbers behind the scenes.\\
